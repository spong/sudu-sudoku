## Super Duper Sudoku!

A feature-rich & UX-friendly Sudoku app a little different than the rest! 
Super Duper Sudoku aims to offer a highly customizable and easy-on-the-eyes Sudoku experience for both mobile and desktop puzzlers! 


#### Project Intent
As I dive back into web development after a healthy stint of Data Science/Engineering & Android development, I wanted a project I could get totally absorbed in, and building UX-focused Sudoku app is just that! Additional intent comes from wanting to see how far along PWA's have come and to provide an ad-free mobile experience.
